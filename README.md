# JoyReactor alternative SPA client

## Demo

You can find latest version of this application hosted on [repository GitHub Pages](https://illja96.github.io/joyreactor)

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. [Angular CLI](https://angular.io)

## Data sources

This project was intended to use only [JoyReactor GraphQL](https://api.joyreactor.cc/graphql-playground).
For now, this is impossible but due to lack of queries and mutations on JoyReactor side.
All of the missing data sources were fulfilled at the expense of html parsing.
